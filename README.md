# JEFFERSON, DEBRA
#
# The VBA formula for the LastRow and LastRowTable calculations were obtained from the instructor during Module 2 classes
# class activities.
#
# The VBA formulas to set the interior cell fill and Excel color index numbers were obtained from the instructor during
# Module 2 classes and class activities.
#
# I did have a tutoring session to help me with problems I was encountering on this assignment. The tutoring session was with Steve Thomas
# on 09.17.2023.  I did not obtain any direct code during this session.  We talked through the bugs in my code and Steve helped me craft a
# "plan-of-attack" to resolve those bugs through general discussion of concepts.  For example, through talking with Steve, I determined that
# I needed a For loop around the code I had written to do the conditional color formatting of the cells in the table the summarizes the data.

# Thank you. -Debbie Jefferson
